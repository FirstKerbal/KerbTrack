KerbTrack
=========

A plugin for Kerbal Space Program that lets you use your webcam with FreeTrack, FaceTrackNoIR or TrackIR to look around in-game by moving your head.

If you don't know where to start, try [AITrack](https://github.com/AIRLegend/aitrack) and set it up to output via TrackIR protocol.
